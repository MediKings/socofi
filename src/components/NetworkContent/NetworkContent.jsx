                <p>« The meeting focused on investments in the Republic of Uganda in the agricultural sector that employs more than 70% of the population, housing modernization and security.
According to the Uganda Poverty Assessment, the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 a day) fell from 62.2% in 2002/03 to 34.6% in 2012/13, representing one of the fastest reductions in poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. Good weather and favorable prices in international and regional markets increased real income from crops, allowing agricultural households to account for up to 79% of the poverty reduction during this period. Other key contributing factors included urbanization and education. However, the vulnerability of people falling back into poverty is very high; for every three Ugandans who get out of poverty, two fall back in, demonstrating fragile gains. Extreme poverty is concentrated in the north and east of the country, accounting for 84% of those living beneath the national poverty line.
Socofi and its partners are committed to working with the authorities to mobilize resources in the agricultural sector, housing construction and security »</p>
